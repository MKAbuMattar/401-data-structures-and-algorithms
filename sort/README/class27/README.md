## Challenge Summary

Solve the merge sort problem and blog about it.


## Challenge Description

Examine the pseudocode below, then follow the steps using the given example array to trace the method. Document your reasoning by writing a blog post that includes a visual representation of the result after each iteration. Once you've finished your article, use the pseudocode given to create a functioning, tested Merge Sort solution.


## Approach & Efficiency

I started by reading the instructions and looking at the pseudocode. Then I prepared the files I'd require for this assignment. I then wrote the blog using the blog example as a guide. I sketched up the blog's whiteboard and jotted down a quick rundown of the code. For this task, the Big O is space O(nlogn), while the Big O is time O(nlogn).
