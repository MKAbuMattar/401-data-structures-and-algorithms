Write a Linked List from the scratch.

Linked List as some functionality 
like `add`, `insert`, `includes`.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

OOP Approach for flexibility and 
exy to read and fix.

O in this approach it not efficient 
because I use `while` for `add`, 
`insert`, `includes`, `print`.

## API

`add` add the data and check if Linked 
List have head or not, in this method 
it will not returns anything, it is a 
public method.

`insert` insert the data and check if 
Linked List have head or not, in this 
method it will not returns anything, 
it is a public method.

`includes` search reserve value and 
check of the Linked List has a size it 
will search at each data in Linked List, 
in this method it will return true or 
false, it is a public method.
