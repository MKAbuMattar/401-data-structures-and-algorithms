# Stacks and Queues
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

Stacks: Java implementation of a stack data structure.

Queues: Java implementation of a queue data structure

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

Stacks: Implement a stack data structure with a 
constructor, and the following methods: 
push, pop, peek and isEmpty.

Queues: Implement a queue data structure with a 
constructor, and the following methods: 
enqueue, dequeue, peek and isEmpty.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

### Stacks

Create tests for each of the items below:

1. When the stack is constructed, a default 
   empty value is assigned to the top. This 
   object should be aware of this.
   
2. Define a method called push that 
   accepts any value as an input and, 
   in O(1) time, adds a new node to the 
   top of the stack with that value.
   
3. Define a pop method that 
   takes no arguments, removes 
   the node from the top of the stack, 
   and returns the value of the node.
   
4. Define a peek method that takes 
   no arguments and returns the 
   value of the node at the top 
   of the stack without deleting it.
   
5. Define a isEmpty method that takes 
   no arguments and returns a boolean 
   indicating whether the stack is empty or not.

### Queues

Create tests for each of the items below:

1. When the queue is established, 
   a default empty value is set to front. 
   This object should be aware of this.
   
2. Define a method called enqueue 
   that accepts any value as an input and, 
   in O(1) time, adds a new node to the rear 
   of the queue with that value.
   
3. Define a dequeue method that 
   takes no arguments, removes the node 
   from the front of the queue, and returns 
   the value of the node.
   
4. Define a peek method that takes no 
   arguments and returns the value of the 
   node at the front of the queue without 
   deleting it.
   
5. Define a isEmpty method that takes 
   no arguments and returns a boolean 
   indicating whether the queue is empty or not.

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Stack and Queue-->

### Stacks

* `push(data)` adds an element to the top of the stack

* `pop()` removes an element from the top of the stack

* `peek()` returns a copy of the element on 
  the top of the stack without removing it

* `isEmpty()` checks whether a stack is empty

### Queues

* `enqueue(data)` add an element to the queue

* `dequeue()` return an element from the front of the queue

* `peek()` returns a copy of the element on
  the front of the queue without removing it

* `isEmpty()` check whether the queue is empty

# Challenge Summary
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

Implement a Queue using two Stacks, 
Create a new PseudoQueue class. 
Do not use an existing Queue. Instead, 
this PseudoQueue class will implement 
our standard queue interface (the two 
methods listed below), but will 
internally only utilize 2 Stack objects.

![PseudoQueue](./PseudoQueue.jpg)

### This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to front when the queue is created.
1. Define a method called 
   enqueue which takes any value 
   as an argument and adds a 
   new node with that value to
   the back of the queue 
   with an O(1) Time performance.
   
2. Define a method called 
   dequeue that does not take 
   any argument, removes the 
   node from the front of the 
   queue, and returns the nodeâ€™s value.
   
3. Define a method called 
   peek that does not take an 
   argument and returns the value 
   of the node located in the front 
   of the queue, without removing 
   it from the queue.
4. Define a method called 
   isEmpty that does not take 
   an argument, and returns a 
   boolean indicating whether 
   the queue is empty.

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->

* `enqueue(data)` add an element to the queue

* `dequeue()` return an element from the front of the queue

* `peek()` returns a copy of the element on
  the front of the queue without removing it

* `isEmpty()` check whether the queue is empty

# Animal Shelter

An animal shelter for 
dogs and cats is 
implemented in Java. 
The refuge operates on 
a first-in, first-out 
basis. An animal rescuer 
can request a cat or a 
dog, and the animal 
type that has been at 
the shelter the longest 
will be given to them. 
If the rescuer does 
not specify, the animal 
that has been at the 
shelter the longest 
will be given to them.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

* Create a class called Animal 
  to represent an animal in the shelter.
* Create a class called DogShelter 
  that extends Animal to represent a dog.
* Create a class called CatShelter 
  that extends Animal to represent a cat.
* Create a class called AnimalShelter 
  which holds only dogs and cats, 
  The shelter operates using a 
  first-in, first-out approach.
* Implement the following methods:
   * enqueue(animal): adds animal to the shelter,
     Animal can be either a dog, or a cat object,
     This method has constant space and time complexity.
   * dequeue(pref): returns either a dog or a cat,
     If pref is not "dog" or "cat" then return

# Challenge Summary
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

This function checks that brackets 
('(', '[', ") in a code file are closed 
appropriately. The function accepts a 
text as input and returns a boolean 
indicating if the brackets 
are appropriately closed.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

* Create a stack to store each brace.
* Traverse the string one character at a time.
* Store each opening brace on the stack.
* When a closing brace is encountered, pop the top brace off the stack.
* If the closing brace does not match the popped opening brace, return false.
* If the stack is not empty after traversal, return false.
* If the stack is empty after traversal, return true.
