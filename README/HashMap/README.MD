## Challenge

implementation from scratch

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

put: incorporates both the key and the value.

get: returns the value from the map based on the key.


hashCode: returns an index in the collection based on an arbitrary key.
